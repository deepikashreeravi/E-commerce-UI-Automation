Feature: User Authentication
  As a registered user
  I want to log into the application
  So that I can access my dashboard

  Background:
    Given the browser is open
    And the user is on the "https://example.com/login" page

  Scenario: Successful Login with valid credentials
    When the user enters "test_user" and "password123"
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should be redirected to the "Dashboard" page
    And a "Welcome" message should be displayed

  Scenario: Unsuccessful Login with invalid password
    When the user enters "test_user" and "wrong_password"
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then an error message "Invalid credentials" should be shown
