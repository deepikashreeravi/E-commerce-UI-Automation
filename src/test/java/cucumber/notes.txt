Feature: User Authentication
  As a registered user
  I want to log into the application
  So that I can access my dashboard

  Background:
    Given the browser is open
    And the user is on the "https://example.com/login" page

  Scenario: Successful Login with valid credentials
    When the user enters "test_user" and "password123"
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should be redirected to the "Dashboard" page
    And a "Welcome" message should be displayed

  Scenario: Unsuccessful Login with invalid password
    When the user enters "test_user" and "wrong_password"
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then an error message "Invalid credentials" should be shown

Key Benefits
Collaboration: Bridges the gap between business and technical teams.

Living Documentation: The tests serve as up-to-date documentation of how the system works.

Automation-Ready: Tools like Cucumber, SpecFlow, or Behave map these steps directly to code snippets (Step Definitions).

Core Components of a Feature File
A standard feature file follows a specific hierarchy to ensure clarity and automation compatibility.

1. Feature
This is the high-level description of the software functionality being tested.

Format: Feature: [Title]

Description: A brief explanation of the business value.

2. Background (Optional)
Used to define steps that are common to all scenarios in the file (e.g., logging in). It runs before every scenario.

3. Scenario
A specific executable example or test case.

Format: Scenario: [Title]

4. Gherkin Keywords (Steps)
Given: The initial context or "pre-condition" (e.g., "Given the user is on the login page").

When: The action or event (e.g., "When the user enters valid credentials").

Then: The expected outcome or "post-condition" (e.g., "Then the dashboard should display").

And / But: Used to add more conditions to any of the above without repeating the keyword.
